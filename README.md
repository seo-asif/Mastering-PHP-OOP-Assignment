## Online Shopping Cart System

In this project, I have implemented a `Product` class that represents a product in the online shopping cart system. The `Product` class has the following properties:

- `id` (integer type): the unique identifier of the product.
- `name` (string type): the name of the product.
- `price` (float type): the price of the product.

In addition to the properties, the Product class should also have the following methods:
1. __construct: a constructor method that takes the id, name, and price as parameters and initializes the corresponding properties of the object.

2. getFormattedPrice: a method that returns the price of the product formatted as a string with two decimal places.

3. showDetails: a method that prints the details of the product (id, name, and formatted price) to the console.
